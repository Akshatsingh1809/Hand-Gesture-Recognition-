# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) based Hand Gesture Control System is a machine-learning model that recognizes different hand gestures using images or sensor data. The goal is to allow users to control computers, robots, VR systems, or smart devices without physical controllers—just by using their hand movements.
